# R-Peak-Detection-Study
A comparative study of python packages for R-Peak detection and the construction of a Meta-Algorithm by applying an Ensemble Majority Weighted-Voting.

--------------------------------------------

Welcome to the forefront of cardiac signal processing! In the realm of R-peak detection, where precision and efficiency are paramount, this study delves into a comprehensive exploration of Python packages renowned for their prowess in cardiac signal analysis. The packages under scrutiny include **'biosppy'**, **'neurokit2'**, **'wfdb'**, **'py-ecg-detectors'**, **'sleepecg'**, and **'heartpy'**, each heralded for its unique approach and capabilities.

Venturing beyond a mere comparison, this research endeavors to synthesize the strengths of these packages into a unified Meta-Algorithm. The spotlight here is on the innovative application of Ensemble Majority Weighted-Voting, a technique poised to elevate the accuracy and reliability of R-peak detection.
